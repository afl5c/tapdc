		<h2>What is TAP Edge?</h2>
		<p>
			In 2014, the Taiwanese American Professionals of Washington, D.C. (TAP-DC) launched its first ever mentor program, TAP Edge. Meant specifically to bridge the DMV Taiwanese/Taiwanese-American community, Edge pairs local undergraduate students with successful professionals for one-on-one career, academic, and life guidance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether itâ€™s meeting up for a mock-interview or going out for some delicious Taiwanese treats, pair, pod, and program events are designed to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build the Taiwanese/Taiwanese-American community through creating meaningful and lasting relationships</li>
			<li>Maximize professional resources within the network to enable more job opportunities</li>
			<li>Develop greater awareness of a shared Taiwanese heritage and culture</li>
			<li>Engage with DMV communities through community service at food banks, soup kitchens and local gardens</li>
		</ul>

			Bike THERE is an annual event for Taiwanese Americans to explore their heritage and strengthen their Taiwanese-American identities and communities. Bike THERE, Be THERE.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Taiwanese Heritage Expedition (THERE) is a program put together by Taiwanese American Professionals of Washington, D.C. (TAP-DC) to promote and sustain economic and cultural ties between Taiwanese and Taiwanese-Americans of all generations, past, present, and future. Bike THERE is a culturally unique and decisively significant opportunity that is and will continue to be a testament to the strength of Taiwanese and Taiwanese-American relations. Bike THERE consists of a 9-day bicycle trip around Taiwan and is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for accepted participants to immerse themselves in the natural beauty of Taiwan, its people, and its culture.
